# GlPortal Contribution Guide
## Developer

## Artist
- Contact us through [gitter](https://gitter.im/GlPortal/glPortal?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) or [irc](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23glportal&uio=d4).

### Composers
- Check our [music guidelines](https://github.com/GlPortal/specification/blob/master/music.md).
- Add your note-sheets to our [repository](https://github.com/GlPortal/music).

## Quality Control
- If there is anything wrong with a commit do one of the following
  - Only if you can't fix it yourself comment objectively on the commit and tell the commiter exactly what the commit breaks. If you don't do this polite don't expect anyone to listen to you or aknowledge your existence.
  - Implement the change yourself and if you are not sure if everybody will agree then propose the change as a pull request (either way the chance to travel back in time is implied by git so mistakes are not to be treated as a catastrophy. If you want to do that you should work on center stage in a theater not on an open source project).
