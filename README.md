## Getting Started For Beginners
These are instructions on how to setup your computer to be able to create your own copy of the project and edit it.
First, if you have not already, download [GitHub Desktop]<https://desktop.github.com/>.
Second, download [Git]<https://git-scm.com/downloads> onto your computer.
Next, set your Git username by opening Git Bash, set user name (git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"), then confirm you set it correctly (git config --global user.name).
Then set your commit email address in the Git Bash as well type (git config --global user.email "email@example.com"), then confirm it (git config --global user.email), then add this email to your commit email on GitHub so that your commits will appear in your contrubutions graph.
Next, I'd recommend downloading [Notepad++]<https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.6.html> so that you can open the code files and veiw them in a nice format.
Now you are ready to start making contrubutions!
